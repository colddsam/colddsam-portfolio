# SIMPLE PORTFOLIO

In this project I have used simple HTML,SCSS and Java Script to make a static portfolio website.

<h2>Tech Stack : </h2>

- HTML
- SCSS
- Java Script

<h2>Main Features : </h2>

It is a static website where using the index.html file is the root HTML file. It has 5 section About, Skills, Experience, Projects and Contact.

The contact portion is still in working process.

<h2>Future Implementation : </h2>
In future I will try to make it a dynamic website and also try to add some animation on it to make it more attractive.
